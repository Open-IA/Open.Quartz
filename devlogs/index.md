Quartz is a fast, batteries-included static-site generator that transforms 
Markdown content into fully functional websites. Thousands of students, developers, 
and teachers are already using Quartz to publish personal notes, websites, 
and [digital gardens](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) to the web.

## 🪴 Get Started

Quartz requires **at least [Node](https://nodejs.org/) v22** and `npm` v10.9.2 
to function correctly. Ensure you have this installed on your machine before continuing.

Then, in your terminal of choice, enter the following commands line by line:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git
cd quartz
npm i
npx quartz create
```

This will guide you through initializing your Quartz with content. Once you've 
done so, see how to:

1. Writing content in Quartz
2. Configure Quartz's behaviour
3. Change Quartz's layout
4. Build and preview Quartz
5. Sync your changes with GitHub
6. Host Quartz online
